# Introduction
This is an exercise to learn React, Redux, Material UI, and SpringBoot.

I completed writing a Todo Application using React and Spring Boot, a step on my way to write a React Reduct Typescript SpringBoot Todo application. It supports Hypermedia Controls (dynamic forms) and Events (open two browser tabs, update a record in one and observe its redenring in the other tab to reflect the update). This is a link to the repository.

This is a link to the live version, deployed to Heroku, because GitHub pages does not support deployment of JAR files.

My next step will be to integrate Redux and write the client in Typescript. And then I'll be done!
